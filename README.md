# ðŸ›’ Blinkit Quick-Commerce Data Analysis with Power BI
In this educational case study, I explore how Blinkitâ€”a leading quick-commerce grocery platformâ€”leverages Power BI to drive operational excellence and enhance customer experiences through data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“Š Project Objectives & Data Overview
Using the fictional Grocery Sales dataset (CSV file), containing 12 key fields about products and outlets:

- Item_Identifier	-  Unique product ID

- Item_Weight	   -   Product weight

- Item_Fat_Content -	Low-fat or regular

- Item_Visibility -	Percent display share

- Item_Type	- Product category

- Item_MRP -	Maximum Retail Price

- Outlet_Identifier -	Unique store ID

- Outlet_Establishment_Year	- Year the outlet opened

- Outlet_Size	- Store size category

- Outlet_Location_Type	- Urban / Semi-Urban / Rural

- Outlet_Type	- Grocery store or supermarket

- Item_Outlet_Sales -	Target variable: sales per outlet

- I loaded this dataset into Power BI to perform several analyses and build interactive visualizations.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Analyses & Visualizations:

- Top-10 Best-Selling Products - Ranks products based on total Item_Outlet_Sales across all outlets.

- Outlet Type vs. Average Sales (Bar Chart) - Compares average sales performance for Grocery Stores vs Supermarkets.

- Geographical Sales Performance - Analyzes average sales by Outlet_Location_Type to identify regional trends.

- Fat Content Distribution (Donut Chart) - Displays the proportion of low-fat vs regular items in the inventory.

- Outlet Age vs. Sales (Line Chart) - Maps outlet establishment year against total sales to explore maturity-performance relationships.

- Top Item Categories by Sales - Shows which product categories generate the highest revenue.

- Average MRP by Item Type - Visualizes pricing differences across categories using an appropriate visualization (e.g., column or cluster chart).

- KPIs Dashboard Elements

    - Total Sales
      
    - Average MRP
      
    - Number of Distinct Items

These are displayed with Power BI KPI visuals for quick business summary.

## âœ… Why This Case Study Matters
